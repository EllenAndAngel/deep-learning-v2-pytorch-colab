# Deep Learning (PyTorch) using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

This repository is a modified clone of [Deep Learning (PyTorch)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch) which contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

These notebooks are modifed to be self-contained to work in colab. Only the exercises are included and not the solutions
